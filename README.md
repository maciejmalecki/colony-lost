# A note to crackers

This is generally a work-in-progress so it does not make sense to crack it.

However, in the future, I have no objections of cracking as long as you credit me.
Generally, it makes sense to crack versions from "main" branch only.
Especially, a tagged versions (major.minor.patch) are eligible for cracking.
